## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Cyrl! ðŸ–¤

As a Full Stack Developer and UX/UI Designer, I bring a blend of technical expertise and creative insights to build user-centric digital solutions. 

With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, TypeScript, Node.js, and MongoDB, I specialize in developing applications that enhance both user experience and organizational growth. 

My experience in data analysis, gained through diverse work environments, allows me to interpret market trends, client behaviors, and financial data, enabling me to make data-driven decisions and create actionable insights for business strategies.

In addition to my technical skills, my years in customer service, sales, and account management have provided me with a solid understanding of how to balance both business and client needs. 

This experience has taught me the importance of client satisfaction, relationship-building, and effective communication, all of which are essential in delivering tailored solutions that align with business goals.

Skilled in project coordination, I excel in managing multiple projects from initiation to completion, ensuring that deadlines are met without compromising quality. I am proficient in tools like Jira and Asana and thrive in cross-functional team environments, aligning diverse teams to deliver seamless results. 

My commitment to continuous learning is demonstrated through my ongoing portfolio, where I showcase my growth in both technical and creative domains, as well as my dedication to staying at the forefront of emerging technologies.
